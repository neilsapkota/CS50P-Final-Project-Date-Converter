# CS50P-Final-Project-Date-Converter
-------------------------------------


Whatâ€™s Inside the Project
--------------------------------
1. Core Functionality
 
     - Date Conversion:
     -Converts dates between AD (Gregorian) and BS (Bikram Sambat) calendars
     using custom algorithms that account for:
     - Nepali calendar month structures (e.g., varying month lengths like Baishakh having 30/31 days).  
     - Leap-year rules specific to the BS calendar.
  
    
2. Validation & Error Handling  
   - Ensures invalid dates (e.g., February 30) are rejected .  
   - Validates user inputs to prevent crashes.  



3. What Can It Do?
   - Solve Real-World Problems:  

  - The Nepali calendar is widely used in Nepal for festivals, 
    government documents, and cultural events. This tool automates
    error-prone manual conversions, saving time and reducing mistakes . 
 
  - Language Accessibility:
    Enables users unfamiliar with the Nepali language to interact with BS dates (and vice versa). 
 
  - Educational Value:
    Demonstrates practical application of Python for calendar algorithms and localization .
